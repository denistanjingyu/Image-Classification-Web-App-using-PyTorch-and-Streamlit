## Steps to use the application


## Model Used
### ResNet-101
ResNet-101 is a convolutional neural network that is 101 layers deep. You can load a pretrained version of the network trained on more than a million images from the ImageNet database. The pretrained network can classify images into 1000 object categories, such as keyboard, mouse, pencil, and many animals.

## Installation
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
